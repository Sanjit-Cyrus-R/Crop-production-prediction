# Crop-production-prediction
## Introduction 
The need to increase agricultural output is more important than ever because of the world's population growth and the threat posed by climate change. The foundation of this effort is crop production, which is essential to global economic stability and food security. Understanding how crucial it is to maximize crop yields, our study sets out to examine, evaluate, and ultimately enhance the complexities of agricultural production.This project focuses on the variables that affect crop production using correlation coefficient and ANOVA analysis, Another focus is also on building a machine learning model that accurately predicts the crop production
